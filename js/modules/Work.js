            <p>Although I aspire to one day change the world with my code, one
              of the biggest passions in my life is learning. I want to start my
              career by tackling problems for my clients and growing in my
              experience with each line of code. I enjoy expressing creativity,
              which I hope to use in creating software that impacts people's
              lives.
